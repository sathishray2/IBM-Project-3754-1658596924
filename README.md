Detecting Parkinson’s Disease using Machine Learning

#### What is meant by Parkinson's Disease?
> Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder may also cause stiffness or slowing of movement.
Parkinson Disease is a brain neurological disorder. It leads to shaking of the body, hands and provides stiffness to the body. No proper cure or treatment is available yet at the advanced stage. Treatment is possible only when done at the early or onset of the disease. These will not only reduce the cost of the disease but will also possibly save a life. Most methods available can detect Parkinson in an advanced stage; which means loss of approx.. 60% dopamine in basal ganglia and is responsible for controlling the movement of the body with a small amount of dopamine. More than 145,000 people have been found alone suffering in the U.K and in India, almost one million population suffers from this disease and it’s spreading fast in the entire world.

#### Project information
> More than 10 million people are living with Parkinson’s Disease worldwide, according to the Parkinson’s Foundation. While Parkinson’s cannot be cured, early detection along with proper medication can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life.

- The researchers found that the drawing speed was slower and the pen pressure is lower among Parkinson’s patients. One of the indications of Parkinson’s is tremors and rigidity in the muscles, making it difficult to draw smooth spirals and waves. It is possible to detect Parkinson’s disease using the drawings alone instead of measuring the speed and pressure of the pen on paper. Our goal is to quantify the visual appearance(using HOG method) of these drawings and then train a machine learning model to classify them. In this project, We are using, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) image descriptor along with a Random Forest classifier to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.

#### Project objective
- To understand the problem for to classify if it is a regression or a classification kind of problem.
- To pre-process the image by using different data pre-processing techniques.
- To implement the algorithm by using OpenCV framework and machine learning to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.
- To know how to find the accuracy of the model.
- To build web application using the Flask framework that features the detection of **Parkinson's Disease**.

#### By what course of action does detection of parkinson's disease makes precise?
**Machine Learning**

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting results without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

## How **Machine Learning** can solve the problem by detecting the parkinson disease?
> The machine learning model can be implemented to significantly improve diagnosis method of Parkinson disease. Parkinson Disease is a brain neurological disorder. It leads to shaking of the body, hands and provides stiffness to the body. No proper cure or treatment is available yet at the advanced stage.

Objective
The main objective of this article is to understand what is Parkinson’s disease and to detect the early onset of the disease. We will use here XGBoost, KNN Algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest Algorithm and utilize the data-set available on UCL Parkinson Data-set under URL (Index of /ml/machine-learning-databases/Parkinsons (uci.edu)).

Parkinson Disease
Parkinson Disease is a brain neurological disorder. It leads to shaking of the body, hands and provides stiffness to the body. No proper cure or treatment is available yet at the advanced stage.

A person diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease can have other symptoms that include-

- Depression

- Anxiety

- Sleeping, and memory-related issues

- Loss of sense of smell along with balance problems.

> Although it develops at age of 65, 15% can be found at young age people less than 50. We will make use of XGBoost, KNN, SVMs, and Random Forest Algorithm to check which is the best machine learning algorithm for detection of the onset of disease.
